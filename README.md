# CIPHE - M1 Internship

## About this repo 

The purpose of this git is to share the scripts, files and tests of the tools I developed during the period of April 5 until June 1.\
These tools are hosted on the **CIPHE server** as will be shown in the examples and tutorials available inside the files.\
As a result, the main way to test the different tools is to connect to the CIPHE network.\
Alternatively, I can help in providing support in modifying the scripts in order to test them in local for people that are interested.
